            <dt><span class="faqTitle">What is Natural Flooring?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>Natural floorings are carpets/rugs made from natural fibers, either vegetable, such as Seagrass, Sisal, Mountain Grass or Jute; or animal such as Wool.</p></span>
            </dd>
            </li>
            <li>    
            <dt><span class="faqTitle">What is Sisal and where does it come from?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>Much of our Sisal is produced in Kenya and Tanzania and is extracted from the Agave sisal plant. Its long, fine, fibrous qualities permits the sisal to be spun into smooth textured yarn. Sisal contains tough fibers that add to its durability. The fibers versatility offers a wide range of use. This natural anti-static, sound-absorbing, flame-retardant, long-lasting fiber makes it an ideal product for your home. Colors for this material can range from a pale yellow to a creamy white.</p></span>

            </li>
            <li>
            <dt><span class="faqTitle">What is Seagrass and where does it come from?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>This durable grass is obtained from a tall plant with grass-like stems found in wetlands. Seagrass can be recognized by its grassy, hay-like scent and coloring which dissipates over time. Seagrass has a non-porous surface that gives it a naturally smooth texture. Its rigidity gives it natural durability. Colors range from sage green hues to olive-like shades.</p></span>

            <li>
            <dt><span class="faqTitle">What about Mountain Grass?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>These plants are found in the high altitude slopes of the Pacific Continent. The grasses rigidity and thickness allow it to take on a wood-like appearance.</p></span>

            </li>
            <li>
            <dt><span class="faqTitle">What is Jute?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>Our Jute comes from India and is extracted from stem fiber plants, similar to flax and hemp. Due to its firmness and stability, this fiber is suited for the manufacturing of stable and durable yarns and fabrics. Jute varies in colors from light tans to browns, which are visible in each rug.</p></span>

            <dt><span class="faqTitle">How do I care for Bamboo Rugs?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>Bamboo is a woody material and like any other material of its kind, its surface is vulnerable to scratching and chipping by sharp edged objects. It is best to keep sharp objects away from the rug.</p></span>

            <dt><span class="faqTitle">What type of backing do Natural Fiber floor coverings have?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>

                        Seagrass, Mountain Grass and Sisal rugs are backed with natural latex. This is a must in natural floor coverings for dimensional steadiness and of great help in cleaning. Fine dirt retention and filtration through to the underlay is a major issue with all carpets. This dirt acts like sandpaper once it has filtered through. The latex backing itself stops a large majority of filtration which can then be removed by vacuuming.

                        All Bamboo carpets have felt backing while our Jute rugs have no backing.

            <dt><span class="faqTitle">Why doesn't my rug match the sample?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>This is common when dealing with natural fiber floor coverings. Color and texture may vary from the sample, due to seasonal fiber growing conditions. Irregularities in the weaving, knots and color are naturally occurring. These slight variations add to the carpet's uniqueness and beauty. What size should my rug be?</p><p>It all depends on the look you are after. If you are looking for a throw rug, any standard rug size would work. This depends on the coverage you are looking for. However, if you want your finished wood floors to be seen, you might want to allow one or two feet of the floor to show around the rug on each side. To a large degree, choosing the size of an area rug comes down to personal preference. You may be looking for a rug to underscore a coffee table, or you may be searching for something to put in the front entry. There are certain situations, though, that require you follow some guidelines. If you're shopping for a rug that will define a conversation grouping, start by putting your floor plan on paper. Then experiment with standard rug sizes. The right rug will accomplish one of two things: It will either be large enough so that all of your seating pieces will fit comfortably on top of it or it will be at least large enough for the front legs of each to fit. As a general rule, the sofa shouldn't be completely on the rug while any accompanying chairs should be big enough so that, when a seated diner pushes back the chair, the back legs don't get caught in the process.</p><p>Area Rugs are one of the easiest ways to delineate spaces in a large room. Two area rugs, matched in color and style but not in size, visually divide a room into two distinct seating areas. Both rugs are large enough to comfortably accommodate their respective groupings.</p></span>

            <dt><span class="faqTitle">Can I use natural fiber for wall to wall covering?</span></dt>
            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>Sisal, Seagrass, Bamboo and Mountain grass are good for wall to wall installation. Jute is the only material that we do not sell in square yardage and/or square footage</p><p>The end result of a Natural Fiber installation is beautiful, however it can be expensive. You will need to consult a professional carpet installer with experience in wall to wall installation using Natural Fiber flooring. We highly recommend this, due to the fact that there are extra steps involved in the installation and it has to be handled differently than synthetic carpeting.</p></span>

            <dd>    
                <span class="faqAns"><p>These are characteristics that reappear in the carpet where no guarantee can be made that one piece of carpet would be different, or more perfect than the other. The most common looks that you should expect are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A few plugs -the fibers have to be tied off on the manufacturing process. </li>
                        <li>Some irregularities in the ribs, some might be close, some will be further apart, especially in <a title="Jute" href="/jute">jute rugs</a>.</li>
                        <li>Variation in bowing and in loop size can occur.</li>
                        <li>All natural fibers tend to return to their original colors. Colors can fade over time.</li>
                        <li>Direct sunlight should be avoided to preserve color.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Natural Floorings should wear well under light to medium traffic conditions and can be laid successfully in most domestic and some commercial situations apart from areas subject to exceptional humidity, heat or dampness (bathrooms, basements, and kitchens). They are not recommended for any location where heavy traffic is anticipated.</p>
                    <p>In an office situation we usually recommend that a loose mat should be laid under chairs with castors.</p>
                    <p>Jute rugs products are normally only recommended for light wear areas.</p>
                    <p>In order to guard against mold and mildew, never store or leave a natural fiber rug in an unventilated area.</p>

    <h1>CARE, MAINTENANCE &amp; CLEANING OF YOUR CONTEMPORARY AREA RUGS</h1>

    <img height="310" src="htt://www.naturalarearugs.com/xnar/templates/front/narb/image_oldnar/splash_care.jpg" alt="Care, Maintenance &amp; Cleaning of your Contemporary Area rugs" height="280"/>

    <h3>
        <b>General Rug Care</b>
    </h3>
    <p>To keep your rug looking vibrant and new you should vacuum regularly. The best way to vacuum thoroughly is to vacuum the rug from several different directions, passing over each area of the rug several times.</p><br/>
    <p>Rugs placed in high-traffic areas tend to have heavier soil build-up and need to be thoroughly vacuumed on a regular basis in order to prolong the beauty and life of the rug.</p><br/>
    <p>For hand-tufted rugs such as wool and shag, you should go over your carpet regularly using an upright vacuum cleaner that has beater-bar action (but no teeth or combs). For everyday cleaning, simply shake the rug to remove loose dirt and fluff pile.</p><br/>
    <p>In the event that liquid spills onto your rug, use a dry, undyed cloth to blot (NOT rub) the liquid. We recommend using <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&q=Host+Dry+Acrpet+Cleaner&sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&ie=UTF-8#q=Host+Dry+Carpet+Cleaner&hl=en&sa=X&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&prmd=ivns&source=univ&tbs=shop:1&tbo=u&ei=pbYLTaH6EIyisAPG8dGsCg&oi=product_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CEMQrQQwAw&fp=83f87efc6f926f13"><b>Host Dry Carpet Cleaner</b></a>.</p><br/>
    <p>Always refer to care tags attached to your rugs for specific instructions.</p>
    <h3><b>Cleaning the Border on Your Rug</b></h3><br/>
    <p>In the event that liquid spills onto your rug's border, use a dry, undyed cloth to blot (NOT rub) the liquid. We recommend using <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&q=Host+Dry+Acrpet+Cleaner&sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&ie=UTF-8#q=Host+Dry+Carpet+Cleaner&hl=en&sa=X&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&prmd=ivns&source=univ&tbs=shop:1&tbo=u&ei=pbYLTaH6EIyisAPG8dGsCg&oi=product_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CEMQrQQwAw&fp=83f87efc6f926f13"><b>Host Dry Carpet Cleaner</b></a>. If solids are dropped on the carpet border, scrape off whatever spilled first. Dampen cloth with the proper cleaning agent for the type of stain. Wipe the area gently, working from the outer edge to the center of the spot. Turn the cloth frequently so it is always clean. Repeat this process until the spot is removed. Dry the carpet by weighing down a pad of absorbent tissues or cloth to absorb the moisture, then circulate with a fan or hair dryer.</p><br/>
    <p><b>Important: NEVER</b> saturate your rug with water or any type of carpet cleaner. Steam cleaning, wet shampooing or any cleaning method involving excessive moisture should not be used as it  can cause the dimensions of your rug to change or cause shrinkage in the border.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>For spot-cleaning, use a mixture of water with a very small amount of detergent (such as a neutral one used for hand-washed garments) or a household solvent.</li>
        <li>Use as little cleaner as possible to avoid excessive wetting which may damage the carpet.</li>
        <li>Removing stains with color in them may require extra effort, and some stains containing dyes such as ink, lipstick, paint or shoe polish may be impossible to remove.</li>
        <li>For cleaning cotton bindings or borders, you may use EverBlum&reg; Cleaning Fluid by Albatross.</li>
        <li>If you are unable to remove a stain, consult a professional carpet cleaner.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>There are methods of Dry Extraction that can be used to clean stains and spills from your rug. For more information on these methods, visit <a href="http://www.hostcarpetcleaning.com/">www.hostcarpetcleaning.com</a>.</p><br/>
<p>Always test the cleaning method you choose to employ on a small, concealed area first to be sure that the color of your rug is not affected.</p><br/>
<p><i>Natural Area Rugs is happy to offer these recommendations for helping you keep your rug looking it's best, but is not responsible for the cleaning and overall care of your rug. Please keep these helpful pointers in mind as the responsibility for cleaning and maintenance lies with the person who performs that task.</i></p>

<h2><b>Rotation</b></h2><br/>
<p>Another way to keep your rug looking fresh is to rotate it at least once a year. In higher traffic zones rotate your rug more often for even wear. If your rug has constant exposure to the sun it will fade, occasional rotation will equalize the effects.</p><br/>
<p>If you find that your rug is being exposed to a lot of sunlight, it may be time to look at your window coverings. Blocking out harmful UV rays will help keep your carpet/rugs looking bright and beautiful.</p>

<h2><b>Professional dry extraction methods of cleaning are recommended.</b></h2><br/>
<p>With proper maintenance and care your Natural Floor Coverings will remain beautiful and functional for years. However, be aware that natural fibers may not be the best choice for every condition. Also, the responsibility for cleaning and maintaining lies with those who perform the task. These cleaning and maintenance guidelines provide a practical guideline to keeping the floor covering looking its best. <strong>No warranty is expressed or implied.</strong></p><br/>

<h2><b>Unpacking Instructions</b></h2><br/>
<p>Immediately after your rug was produced, it was laid flat, rolled on a core and wrapped in plastic before shipping to preserve its beauty and vibrant quality.</p>
<h3><b>Unrolling Your Rug</b></h3><br/>
<p>When you receive your rug and carefully unroll it, you will notice waves may have formed on the surface. These waves are a result of the stress of rolling and shipping the product.  Lay your rug on a completely flat surface and as the rugs settle and relax, those waves will disappear within 24-28 hours.</p>
<h3><b>Training the Corners of Your Rug</b></h3><br/>
<p>When your rug was rolled, it was either rolled face in, or face out, depending on the border. If your rug corners are not laying flat, lay the rug on a completely flat surface and loosely fold the curling edge and allow it to sit that way for 24-48 hours. After that, your rug's corners will be trained and will lay flat.</p><br/>
<p>Your beautiful new rug will be relaxed and laying perfectly on any surface after following the simple steps above.</p><br/>
<p><b>Important Notice:</b> <b><i>Do Not</i></b> pull your rug by the bordered edges. This action may cause damage.</p><br/>
<p>Your rug is a natural fiber rug and is woven from natural materials that tend to have irregularities, because it is common for irregularities to occur in nature. Do not be alarmed if you find different characteristics in the weave or shading of your rug as they are inherent in the manufacturing process.  One of the most exciting things about purchasing a natural fiber rug is that there is no one in the world with a rug that is exactly like yours. The characteristics of nature that are present in your rug give it a unique, distinctive personality.</p>

<h2><b>How to Make the Rugs Lay Flat</b></h2><br/>
<p>One of the most important aspects of maintaining the quality and durability of any indoor area rug is routine care and maintenance. One of the first things to begin to wear on any area rug is the corners.</p><br/>
<p>The corners of an area rug can begin to fray or start bending upward, creating a possible hazard for people to trip on. A trick of the trade to maintaining the integrity and quality of your area rug is using <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&q=intertape+indoor+carpet+tape&sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&ie=UTF-8&aq=0&oq=intertape+indoor#q=intertape+indoor+carpet+tape&hl=en&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbs=shop:1&ei=LZgSTeKGJom4sAOXj62zCg&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CBwQ_AU&biw=1280&bih=771&fp=83f87efc6f926f13"><b>Intertape Indoor Carpet Tape</b></a>. Indoor carpet tape can easily be placed under the four corners of the area rug, ensuring it is attached to the floor and unable to be moved.</p><br/>
<p>Indoor carpet tape is used to hold carpets, area rugs and smaller mats on virtually any surface including tile, hardwood and laminate. The tape is durable, strong and heavy-duty with double sided adhesion. The tape is made for indoor conditions and works best in low-moister environments. The tape won't rot and is engineered for semi-permanent situations. </p><br/>
<p>Another option is to use <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&q=intertape+indoor+carpet+tape&sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&ie=UTF-8&aq=0&oq=intertape+indoor#sclient=psy&hl=en&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS288US289&biw=1280&bih=771&tbs=shop:1&q=performix+super+grip&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=d905516b4d416d47"><b>Performix Super Grip</b></a> which is an air dry non-skid fabric coating. It creates a synthetic rubber coating which bonds the area rugs to the floor to stop skidding and shifting.</p><br/>
<p>Prevention is one of the most important aspects of care and maintenance for area rugs. Many times people don't pay special attention to their area rugs until something drastic happens. It is taking the small, simple steps such as using indoor carpet tape to prevent larger disasters from transpiring. If you do nothing else to help care for your area rugs, use indoor carpet tape for peace of mind.</p><br/>
<p>In addition to using indoor carpet tape it's important that you vacuum your area rug on a regular basis, clean it professionally at least once a year or every six months and ask people to remove their shoes while in your home. Foot wear is one of leading causes of damage to rugs. Socks and bare feet hardly have a negative impact on your rug, while the rough soles from shoes can do a great deal of damage. </p><br/>
<p>Make care and maintenance for your area rugs of the upmost importance. A little extra effort, time and attention to detail can save you a lot of money and frustration in the future. Take good care of your home area rugs by making a small investment in indoor carpet tape and reap the rewards in the years to come.</p><br/>

<h2><b>How to Remove Sticky Latex from Hardwood Floors</b></h2>
<p>Hardwood floors can be damaged when sticky messes are removed improperly.  The steps below will guide you through the process of safely removing sticky latex from hardwood floors. </p><br/>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:none;">
        <h3 class="how-to"><b>Step 1</b></h3>
        <p>Apply WD-40 to the sticky latex. As you use it work in small sections.</p><br/>
        <p>WD-40 is an excellent tool for removing sticky material from your wood floor because it won't dry on the wood. Even though that is true, work in small sections as this is the safest way to clean your floor.</p><br/>
        <h3 class="how-to"><b>Step 2</b></h3>
        <p>After applying the WD-40 allow up to 5 minutes, or even more if the latex is thick. During this time the WD-40 will break down the latex and interrupt the bond between it and the floor, allowing it to be removed.</p><br/>
        <h3 class="how-to"><b>Step 3</b></h3>
        <p>As the latex begins to loosen its grip begin wiping it away with a cloth scouring pad. If the scouring pad becomes gummed up with latex, change pads for more effective cleaning.</p><br/>
        <h3 class="how-to"><b>Step 4</b></h3>
        <p>Repeat the above steps until all of the latex is removed.</p><br/>
        <h3 class="how-to"><b>Step 5</b></h3>
        <p>There may be remaining residue from the WD-40, use a soft cloth to wipe that up. Be sure to wipe up any residual liquid as it will create a dangerous, slippery area.</p><br/>
        <p><i>Special Note: If you have unfinished wood floors, almost any attempt to clean the floor will cause staining. It is best to use fine grit sandpaper to remove a mess on unfinished wood. </i></p><br/>
