<img src="http://www.naturalarearugs.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shag-0129141.jpg">

<p>Hearing the phrase “shag rug” makes some homeowners cringe because of the rug style’s association with the outdated fashions of the 70s. Until recently, shag rugs were decidedly not in vogue, but as the fashion cycle has re-embraced the decade of bellbottoms and disco, homeowners have come around to shag rugs once more.</p>
<p>And why not? Today’s shag rugs are plusher than ever, super-soft and add instant luxury to any room. Plus, they have a practical side. The deep, thick pile withstands heavy foot traffic, making them perfect for high traffic areas, especially in households with children and pets.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to add a new area rug to your home, don’t write shag rugs off just yet. With some research, you can get the most out of your shag rug and transform any room with a throwback feel that’s still fresh and contemporary.</p>
<p>Before buying a shag rug, do your research on the rug’s quality. A low-quality shag rug will quickly look tattered and matted instead of plush and inviting. Quality starts with the rug’s material and construction, so demand the best.</p>
<p>If you’re shopping in-store, examine the construction of the rug: it should be hand-woven and have a strong backing. Feel the pile itself and if it feels stiff and crunchy instead of soft and plush, keep looking.</p>
<p>Shopping online? It’s still worth your time to experience the construction of a rug first-hand. Send away for a sample of the rugs that you’re considering, and try to order from a manufacturer that imports all of its material directly for quality control. You should also shop around and price-compare so that you get the best deal possible. Look for manufacturers who offer easy returns, free shipping and other perks or discounts to get the most out of your purchase.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider before buying a shag rug is your lifestyle. Shag rugs are, comparatively, high on the maintenance scale, so make sure that you’re prepared to care for them to keep them in the best shape possible. Shag rugs should be regularly vacuumed and shaken, and they also need occasional stain treatment and steam cleaning. Remember to use a rug pad and anti-curling system, plus tape if necessary. By taking care of your shag rug, you’ll ensure that it never goes out of style, no matter the decade.</p>

<strong>INCREASE THE LIFESPAN OF YOUR NATURAL FIBER RUG<br><br></strong>
<p>When you buy a natural fiber rug, you’re relying on its all-natural strength and durability to hold up throughout years of foot traffic and everyday wear and tear. By following these simple tips, you can lengthen the lifespan of your natural area rug to help save you time and money.</p>

<strong>Choose the Right Rug<br>
</strong>
<p>It’s very important that you consider the needs of yourself and your family when shopping for natural fiber rugs. If you know you want to place the rug in a bustling area — such as the living room, kitchen or hallway — that’s going to see a constant stream of foot traffic, be sure to select a rug that’s durable and strong. Busy areas can benefit from seagrass rugs or bamboo rugs thanks to their hardy constructions that can withstand constant abrasion.</p>

<p>You’ll also want to tailor your purchase to suit the rug’s environment. If you’re looking for the perfect rug for the kitchen, craft room or kids’ play area, you want to select the most stain-resistant option possible, like wool or cotton. Similarly, you want to be aware of the natural light levels in the room. Some rugs are less fade-resistant than others, so be sure you’re choosing a fiber that’s going to maintain its quality and color when placed in direct sunlight.</p>
<strong>Maintenance is the Key<br>
</strong>
<p>In order to ensure that your natural fiber rug lasts, you’ll want to closely follow care and maintenance tips specific to the rug’s fiber. As a general rule, most rugs require regular vacuuming and spot-cleaning to ensure that dirt and dust doesn’t get trapped within the rug’s fibers. Always remember to blot — never rub — liquid stains to avoid allowing the material to further absorb the dyes and coloring within the liquid.</p>

<p>Also be sure to tailor your rug-cleaning regimen to suit the type of rug in your home. For example, because bamboo rugs made from a flat, woody material that’s more vulnerable to scratching and chipping than some fiber rugs, you want to be sure you always keep sharp objects away from it. Additionally, you should be aware that deep cleaning some materials, such as wool, is not recommended because it may compromise the texture and quality of the yarn.</p>
<strong>Focus on the specs<br></strong>

<p>You can take preventative measures against rug damage by choosing options that have built-in features to help preserve the quality of the material. For example, many rugs (including seagrass, mountain grass and sisal rugs) are manufactured with a natural, latex backing. This helps the rug filter out fine dirt and dust, which can then be easily removed by vacuuming, to avoid causing permanent damage to the rug itself or the floors beneath.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you know you’re going to place the rug in an area with high foot traffic — or if you have kids or pets — you should opt for a rug that has reinforced binding that’s going to help the rug’s weave resist fringing or tearing over the life of the product. Rugs with wide, cotton or canvas borders also make maintenance and repair easier than those that do not have this feature. Furthermore, many modern natural fiber rugs are reversible, so you can actually expect to get twice the life out of a single purchase.</p>


<strong>PILLOW FEET: WHICH NATURAL AREA RUGS ARE THE SOFTEST?<br><br></strong>
<p>Choosing a super soft area rug can turn a cold, unwelcoming room into a cozy and comfortable living space that’s warm, textured and decadent. Especially ideal if you’re living in a small space (where the floor often doubles as a lounge area or workspace) or have kids who spend a lot of time playing on the floor, you’ll want to choose a super soft rug that’s going to feel like you’re walking barefoot among the clouds. With so many quality options on the market today, you’ll surely find the right option for your home and family.</p>
<img src="http://www.naturalarearugs.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boyd-H.jpg">
<p>Many people assume that when you choose a softer fiber, you’re compromising durability or ease of cleaning. Modern rug-making techniques allow these soft rugs to retain their strength and durability while still offering a pleasant texture. With the right materials, you can achieve that perfect plush feeling underfoot. Use this handy guide to determine which kind of rug materials are the softest — and which are not so soft — to ensure that you get the just-right texture for any high-traffic living area.</p>

<strong>Softest - Wool</strong>
<p>Crafted from fleece of sheep, alpacas and goats, wool is the softest rug material available today. Sometimes blended with other materials that enhance the fiber’s softness, such as cashmere or sisal, wool rugs are truly the finest option if you’re looking for certified softness. Wool is also remarkably strong and durable, so you can feel confident placing it in some of the busier rooms in your home, such as the living room or den. Be sure to choose rugs made with high-quality wool to ensure the highest level of softness and eco-friendliness.</p>
<strong>Softer - Cotton and Silk</strong>
<p>Cotton is perhaps the world’s most versatile material. When woven for rug-making purposes, cotton is treated to ensure that it retains its strength without compromising the fiber’s luxurious softness. Cotton rugs are a great choice for any interior décor scheme because they absorb dyes and other color treatments exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Silk is another softer rug option. This fiber is naturally soft and also offers a subtle yet distinctive sheen that creates an intriguing, eye-catching aesthetic. Always be sure to select rugs made with genuine silk — or genuine silk that has been woven with other materials to add texture and strength — to ensure the highest quality possible.</p>
<strong>Soft - Jute and Sisal</strong>
<p>Sisal rugs feature a smooth, fine surface while still exhibiting a super earthy woven, rope-like texture. Because they are typically made with a wider, flatter weave than other natural fiber rugs, sisal rugs are often much softer to the touch. These rugs are a popular option among homeowners who really want a natural, earthy look that’s still going to enhance a room’s coziness and warmth.</p>

<p>Although it’s a plant-based fiber that comes straight from the earth, jute is an amazingly soft and luxurious rug option for any home. The fibers are woven in a tight basket weave style to enhance the rug’s strength while preserving the material’s luxury and softness. Like silk, jute offers a subtle sheen within each fiber for a dimensional overall appearance.</p>
<strong>Least soft — Bamboo</strong>
<p>While bamboo rugs are technically classified as one of the less soft natural area rug options, they still bring a certain level of cushion and softness to any home. While they aren’t quite as coarse as jute or leather rugs may be underfoot, they’re often designed to mimic a hardwood look, so they feature a more cold and woody appearance than other rug fibers might.</p>
<strong>COLLEGE-DORM-DECOR-101</strong>
<p>A few affordable touches can rid a college dormitory room of that austere look and transform it into a welcome oasis. Think bright prints for splashes of color. Invest in an eco-friendly natural fiber rug to bring a touch of nature to the place.</p>

<p>Stylish college dorm décor should be a no-brainer for smart students. You want a space that’s neat and organized — ideal for late-night study sessions — but also true to your vibrant personality. Once you’ve picked out your color scheme, wall décor (don’t be ashamed to tape posters straight to the wall, as it may be the last chance you’ll ever get to do so) and bedding, tie your theme together with an eco-friendly natural fiber rug for a touch of warmth.</p>

<p>When you’re living in a small and somewhat challenging area like a dorm room, it’s essential that you use every inch of available surface area to help maximize your living space. That might mean creating a cozy study nook on the floor or utilizing space under the bed for storage. The right flooring can help boost your room’s functionality while adding extra style and comfort to areas that might otherwise go unused.</p>

<p>Natural area rugs have wide-spanning appeal. You can find beautifully designed, updated styles in bright and poppy solid colors as well as fun and funky patterns to match your dorm décor. Contemporary natural area rugs feature weaving techniques and patterns that create incredibly intriguing works of art for the floor. Earth-toned rugs are also great when you want to let your room’s accessories and art do the bulk of the talking.</p>

<p>Popular dorm décor ideas for fashion-forward undergrads include black and white color schemes with a singular pop of color, vintage-inspired prints and patterns and functional, fashionable furniture. Cinderblock walls and linoleum tiles can be revitalized with cozy and affordable natural flooring, like soft and earthy jute and bamboo rugs. Shag rugs are always a great suggestion for the vintage-inspired or eclectic dorm room thanks to their retro look and soft, supple foundation for bare feet.</p>

<p>All of these cozy flooring options come in varying prints and patterns to meet your specific décor vision. If you’re going for black and white, decorate with a two-toned wool rug with a chic diamond design. If you want to show your disposition for the fun and funky, you might be inclined to choose a cowhide rug or a leather rug. Many jute and sisal area rugs are reversible, so you get twice the wear from a single rug.</p>

<p>In contrast to synthetic fiber rugs, natural rugs offer exceptional durability and added benefits in addition to their desirable aesthetic. Many natural fiber rugs are anti-static, sound-absorbent and even flame-retardant. They’re also great for students who have allergies, as sisal and seagrass rugs can actually help prevent dust and allergens from getting into the air.</p>

<p>Natural rugs are appealing to students because each one features its own beautiful variations. Because they’re handmade with natural materials like bamboo, jute or seagrass, each one is completely unique. Despite all of these features, natural flooring is also quite affordable, and you can be sure that the quality weaving and texture will hold up throughout years of wear and tear, unlike the cheap rugs found at big box stores and discount rug outlets.</p>

<strng>ECO-FRIENDLY KITCHENS<br><br></strong>

	<p>Let Mother Nature be your guide in adding natural touches to a kitchen crowded with appliances. Transform a windowsill into a miniature herb garden with a few plants inside colorful pots. Add a framed photograph of outdoor plants or flowers to wall space above a counter. A sturdy natural fiber area rug in a neutral shade can bring it all together.</p>

	<p>There are many great ways to turn your kitchen from the most energy- and resource-guzzling room in your home into a smart space that operates cleanly and efficiently. Rather than overhauling all of your appliances and dumping thousands of dollars into a complete kitchen renovation, you can take small and simple steps towards running a more eco-friendly kitchen with these easy, affordable tips. Because the kitchen is probably one of the busiest rooms in your home, it’s a great place to start if you want to make your whole home more eco-conscious.</p>

	<p>It’s wise to incorporate environmentally friendly décor into your home with all-natural flooring like natural fiber rugs. Many people don’t realize that rugs made from natural fibers like bamboo, jute, sisal, mountain grass, seagrass and wool can actually be more durable and long-lasting than traditional flooring, making them great for rooms that see a constant flow of foot traffic. Natural fiber rugs are ideal for laying over ceramic tile or hardwood because they protect the flooring from scratches and stains and feature built-in backings that will help keep the rug in place over slippery and wet surfaces.</p>

	<p>Stronger rug fibers like bamboo and seagrass are constructed to help repel dirt while holding up to constant foot traffic, so you can be sure that your flooring won’t deteriorate after years of day-to-day use and entertaining. These styles are also more stain-resistant than synthetic flooring and some even feature fire-retardant and anti-static properties for additional kitchen safety. No matter the shape or size, lightweight, natural rugs can be easily transported outdoors to be shaken out.</p>

	<p>Today’s natural area rugs come in many textures, colors and sizes to suit your unique kitchen configuration. Contemporary kitchens benefit from the naturally beautiful look and feel of eco-friendly natural fiber flooring that has been woven or dyed into a vibrant and elegant pattern. Neutral rugs provide a warm, welcome aesthetic for earth-toned kitchens, while bold wool or bamboo rugs will complement bright and modern décor schemes.</p>
	<img src="http://www.naturalarearugs.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/seagrass1-022014.jpg">
	<p>Another great way to enhance your kitchen’s sustainability is by installing eco-friendly countertops. Typically constructed from fast-renewing or recycled materials like salvaged glass, reclaimed wood or bamboo, environmentally friendly countertops give you all the practicality of high-cost options like marble or granite without the high price tag and overconsumption. Gorgeous bamboo or rugged reclaimed wood countertops pair perfectly with the all-natural look of natural fiber rugs.</p>

	<p>Small changes can have a big impact when it comes to overhauling your kitchen’s sustainability. Consider implementing super simple enhancements, like saving cooking scraps and cultivating a compost pile to create rich soil and divert waste from entering the landfill. Composting may inspire you to grow vegetables and herbs that you can put back into the kitchen to create healthy meals and save money.</p>

	<p>Other uncomplicated ways to ensure that your kitchen operates at peak efficiency include keeping a stash of reusable grocery bags on hand, keeping your recycling bin easily accessible and replacing your cheap, throwaway cookware and utensils with long-lasting tools that won’t need to be replaced nearly as often.</p>
	<strong>REDUCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CARPET</strong>
	<img src="https://www.naturalhomerugs.com/media/wysiwyg/blog-images/sedona.jpg">

	Carpet is comfy and warm on your feet, but it’s nearly impossible to really clean. And, it’s a perfect home to microorganisms such as mold, mildew and dust mites, in addition to being a reservoir for everything you track indoors on your shoes like lawn chemicals, lead dust, and animal feces. For a child’s developing body and lungs, this can be especially detrimental.</p>

	Still, no one expects you to rip out your carpet and start anew. Some people have no choice in the matter. That’s okay and totally understandable. Just do what you can!</p>

	Follow these easy steps to reduce risks associated with carpeting:</p>

	<p><strong>1. Vacuum often.</strong> For your initial “decontamination” effort, experts recommend vacuuming three times a day for the first month. That may be a bit much for most people’s schedules, just try to do it fairly obsessively for a month. After that, a couple times a week should suffice. Frequent vacuuming helps reduce the level of dust mites, which trigger asthma and allergy attacks. It also means getting rid of surface dirt on carpets before it has a chance to get ground in. A vacuum cleaner with strong suction, rotating brushes and a HEPA filter (so the dirt and dust won’t get blown back out in the exhaust) is best. Go back and forth over the same spot several times – especially in high traffic areas – to get all of the dirt and dust!</p>

	<p><strong>2. Don’t let your kids eat or drink in carpeted areas.</strong> Kids and spills go hand in hand – and spills on carpeting can quickly lead to mold or bug problems (especially since kids aren’t quick to clean up or fess up to the mess). If you make an exception to the rule, be sure to check in and clean up any spills immediately.</p>

	<p><strong>3. Ventilate.</strong> Open windows regularly and use a fan to gently circulate the air. Any airborne contaminants will be flushed out of the room letting your child breathe easier. Consider Energy Star fans to save on energy bills and reduce pollution associated with electricity generation.</p>

	<p>If you ever decide to tear out the carpet, keep the room closed off from the rest of the house. Everything that’s built up in the depths of the fibers will be released during the process. And, since textiles help hold dust in place (instead of constantly drifting through the air and potentially irritating lungs) opt for a hard surface floor with a washable area rug. Then you’ll get the benefits of carpeting without the drawbacks.</p>

	<strong>4 MISTAKES TO AVOID WHEN DECORATING WITH GEOMETRIC AREA RUGS<br><br></strong>



	<p>From floor to ceiling, there are many places and spaces in your home where you can utilize geometric patterns. They can appear on textiles, walls, floors and even light fixtures – but let’s face it, some of those bold patterns can be a little intimidating, right? A good way to begin introducing geometrics into your life is with an area rug. Here are a few things to avoid when working with geometric patterned area rugs.</p>

	<strong>1. Don’t hide it</strong>

	<p>If you have made the leap to buy a geometric rug, don’t tuck it away in a corner or bury it under a large piece of furniture. Geometric rugs are a fantastic opportunity to create a focal point in a room, or to make a statement in any space. Give the rug center stage in your living room, or let it flow freely in a hallway.</p>

	<strong>2. Don’t let it get lonely</strong>

	<p>Geometric Area RugsContrary to what you might believe, patterns love each other. If you are brave enough to put a geometric rug in your living room, then you are brave enough to buy a few throw pillows with a great pattern, too. Other ways you can accessorize your space with pattern are with ceramics, light shades, and even your curtains.</p>

	<strong>3. Don’t be afraid of color</strong>

	<p>Geometric rugs look great in any shade or hue – and while you may be tempted to stick to a neutral palette, adding color to your space will draw the eye more effectively. Rich mustard yellows, gemstone purples and deep blues, all work wonderfully for rugs and help set apart your space. Choosing darker hues in rich colors will also help the carpet wear better. Spilling coffee or red wine on a neutral colored rug may very well ruin it, but a rich tone will allow for a much easier clean up.</p>

	<strong>4. Don’t skimp on size</strong>

	<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of decorating with geometric rugs is getting the correct size for the space. Proportionality can make or break a room. Ensure you buy a rug that fits the room properly. You don’t want it covered your entire floor; leaving exposed wood, or tile around the edges is important. But you don’t want a little postage stamp in the center of a room filled with large couches, bookshelves and tables, either. Choose a geometric rug in a size that will match the space. Measuring the overall size of the room before you shop is key. Our customer sales associates will be able to help you decide what size you need based on your own home.</p>

	<p>Keeping these points in mind, you can easily broaden your home decorating abilities by venturing into the exciting world of geometric patterns. Remember, be bold, be daring, and do let patterns seep into other aspects of your design.</p>

	<strong>4 WAYS TO DESIGN ELEGANT AND INVITING ROOMS WITH SEAGRASS RUGS<br><br></strong>


	<p>Hardwood floors are all the rage right now.  They are easy to clean and add a sense of beauty to any room; however, limiting yourself to hardwood (or laminates that are designed to look like hardwood) in rooms like your living room or your bedroom can leave a lot to be desired.  This is where rugs come in.  Adding an area rug to any space can add a splash of color, originality, and warmth that can create that touch of elegance you’ve been looking for, and choosing from the range of seagrass rugs can provide all that elegance with a hint of uniqueness—but how do you know which rug will be right for your room?</p>

	<p>Here at Natural Home Rugs, we have a lot of seagrass rugs to choose from, and, since they are all unique and beautiful in their own way, it is important to know your space to ensure you are choosing the rug that will really make your room stand out. </p>

	<strong>Here are 4 ways you can create the design you’ve been dreaming about by choosing the right seagrass rug for your space</strong>

	<strong>1) Size is key<br></strong>

	<p>Make sure you choose the right size (and shape) of carpet to match your space.  Adding a seagrass rug that is too small, too big, or the wrong shape for your space can take away from the elegance of the rug—and the room.  When you come in to look at our variety of seagrass rugs, make sure you bring the measurements of your room with you.  Our experts can help you find a size of seagrass rug that will complement your space.  And bring pictures, too.  Knowing what furniture you have where, or what your plans for furniture placement are, can help when selecting the size and shape of rug that will work best for the room.</p>

	<strong>2) Choose a color that compliments—or stands apart<br></strong>

	Seagrass Rugs

	<p>Our seagrass rugs come in a variety of shades and colors.  Particularly popular is our neutral green collection, which ranges from olive green to lighter variations of sage.  Because they tend towards neutral shades, most colors will go well with the current furniture and color scheme of your room; however, if you want a splash of color for an extra creative pop, you can purchase a seagrass rug with a colorful border.</p>

	<strong>3) Consider where the rug is going before you buy<br></strong>

	<p>Seagrass is a fiber that is grown in water, so it is naturally strong and resistant to most spills and stains.  These can easily be wiped up, and you can vacuum over your seagrass rug as well.  Further, they are used in their natural form, not dyed, which means no chemicals or toxins that could cause allergic reactions are used, and there is no chance the dyes will seep into your floors.  They are long-wearing, so can be kept in high-traffic areas, too.  There are places, however, in which you should not place seagrass rugs.  They have a smooth finish, so should not be placed on or near stairways, and, like most natural fibers, they can be susceptible to mold and mildew, so should not be used in areas that are persistently moist or highly humid.</p>

	<strong>4) Find a pattern that speaks to you<br></strong>

	<p>Our natural seagrass rugs are handmade in a number of one-of-a-kind textures, including the original weave, tight-knit weave, basket weave, and even a herringbone weave.  Find a texture that speaks to you, and it’ll be sure to make your room a hit.</p>

	<p>Keeping these 4 tips in mind, selecting the rug that will add the right amount of elegance and charisma to your space will be a lot easier.  Visit us at Natural Home Rugs today to view our extensive selection.</p>
