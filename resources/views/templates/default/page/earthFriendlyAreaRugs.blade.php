    <p class="fontText">There are so many different ways that people all over the world are helping contribute to the stability of our planet by making eco-friendly choices.  What may come as a shock to many consumers, is that there is even an eco-friendly option when it comes to carpet. </p>
    <p class="fontText">The standard carpet that covers 70% of floors across the United States often contains materials that can be hazardous and can even affect your health.  Many are familiar with that &quot;new carpet smell&quot;, but what they probably don't know is that the smell comes from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are emitted as gases. Some side effects of exposure to VOCs are headaches, allergic skin reactions, irritation in the nose and throat, fatigue and dizziness. It is not recommended that carpet containing VOCs be used in baby nurseries as the gases emitted are not something that should be looming in the air around a new baby.  Allergies are a common problem for families and can often be attributed to the carpet in their home.</p>
    <p class="fontText">In addition to the health challenges that come with standard carpeting, the manufacturing of this type of flooring costs a great deal when it comes to the health of our planet. It takes incredible amounts of energy and water to manufacture this type of carpet.<p>
    <p class="fontText">Natural carpeting offers exciting and life-changing benefits to any who use it in their home or office.  Natural carpets are made from rapidly renewable materials that come from plants.  As fibers grow they can be harvested over and over again, causing no harm to our environment.  Because of the materials that make up natural carpets, there is no eco-damaging manufacturing involved.</p>
    <p class="fontText">Natural carpeting can be made of fibers from plants or animal fibers such as wool.  Wool can be harvested and made into a rug and provide it's owner with a durable, soft rug that will not damage or be worn out quickly.</p>
    <p class="fontText">For anyone prone to suffer from allergies, natural carpeting is the perfect choice. Natural carpets great reduce allergens in the air and are also much easier to clean and maintain. Natural rugs and carpets are available in so many styles and colors. Rugs can be created from bamboo, organic wool or cotton, sisal, seagrass, shag, jute and cork.  Natural rugs add character and vitality to any room.</p>
    <p class="fontText">There so many benefits of using natural, eco-friendly carpeting. In addition to the benefits of better health and cleanliness, when you incorporate sustainable materials in your home, it creates a cozy, organic environment. As you consider your next carpet, keep in mind the impact choosing floor covering made from naturally renewable materials will have. Your purchase can help create a world where quality, beauty and an eco-friendly way of life is not only achievable, but sustainable.</p>		<br>
