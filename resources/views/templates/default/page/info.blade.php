<h2>Care and Maintenance</h2>
<p>We recommend that your natural fiber rugs be thoroughly cleaned every six months or once a   year, depending on the amount of traffic.</p><h3>Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Use vacuum cleaners with suction and brushing capabilities. Upright or canister type cleaners can both be used. Vacuum from various                  directions making several passes over an area several times to achieve best results. Pay extra attention to heavy traffic areas, which                require more frequent cleaning to reduce dirt build-up and prolong the beauty and life of the carpet.</p>

<p>For Shag Rugs and Wool Rugs, You should vacuum your carpet regularly using an upright vacuum cleaner having a beater-bar action (but no              teeth or combs). For everyday cleaning, simply shake the rug to remove loose dirt and fluff pile.</p>

<p>Always refer to care tags attached to your rugs for specific instructions.</p>
<h3>Dealing with spills and stains</h3>
<p>Spills require immediate attention. Liquids should be blotted with a clean undyed cloth, which is to be pressed firmly all around for                maximum absorption. Solid materials on the other hand, should be scraped out using a spoon or spatula. Moisten cloth with appropriate                  cleaning agent (depending on the type of stain). Wipe affected areas gently working from the outside towards the center. Cloth must be                turned frequently and kept clean. Never saturate carpet with water. This process must be repeated until spot is removed. Dry carpet by                weighing down absorbent tissues or cloth, then circulate with a fan or hair dryer.</p>

<p>Spot cleaning - dissolve a small amount of mild detergent (such as those used for hand-washed garments) or household solvent in water
Use as little cleaner as possible to avoid saturation, which can cause damage to the carpet
Certain stains with color may take more effort to remove. Stains from ink, lipstick, paint, or shoe polish may be impossible to remove.
Should you find it too difficult to remove a stain, consult professional carpet cleaner</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>Periodically rotate your rug every six months to alter the traffic pattern on your rug's surface. Never utilize hot water extraction or wet        shampooing procedures which can cause shrinkage or staining of natural fiber. For thorough cleaning, always consult an experienced professional        cleaner who deals with Natural Fiber Floor covering.</p>

<p>With proper care and maintenance, Natural Floor Coverings should last for years. Keep in mind, however, that natural fibers might not be            suitable for certain conditions or situations. Also, the responsibility for cleaning and maintaining lies with those who perform the task.            These cleaning and maintenance guidelines provide a practical guideline to keeping the floor covering looking its best. No warranty is                expressed or implied.</p>
