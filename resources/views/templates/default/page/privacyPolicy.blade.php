                <h2><b>Credit Card Security</b></h2>

                <p> We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of credit card transmissions. This technology encrypts your credit card information. </p>

                <h2><b>How to make sure you are on a secure server:</b></h2>

                <p> Before entering your personal financial information, there are things you can watch out for to make sure the SSL is active and that you are on a secure server. </p>

                <ul style="list-style:decimal">

                    <li><h3>Look at the bottom of your browser. Depending on your browser you should see an unbroken key or a closed lock icon. This indicates that your SSL is active and that you are accessing a secure server. </h3></li>

                    <li><h3>Another security check that is easy to perform is to look up at the URL or location line of your browser. The first characters of a secure server will have changed from &ldquo;http&rdquo; to &ldquo;https.&rdquo; </h3></li>

                </ul>

                <p> If your browser doesn&rsquo;t permit communication through secure servers, or you can&rsquo;t seem to access our secure server, just send an email to our <a href="mailto:info@naturalarearugs.com">Customer Service</a> department. You may also send a fax to (323) 582-1117. </p>
